// What we tell people about public Q&A, in one place. The user's picture for it (2026-10-04): asking
// here is like raising your hand at a recorded talk, so the questions and answers are public but
// carry no names, and the situation is a note passed to the stage. lizheng.ai uses the same words
// on its homepage section and in its privacy policy: its scripts/sync-ask-app.mjs copies this file
// to shared/ask-public-qa.js, and its tests check the policy still says the same. Edit it here.
//
// In the Chinese text {owner} is who answers from his own material (立正 on this page, 我 on the
// homepage), {self} is how the same sentence refers back to him (他 or 我), and {answerer} is the
// service that writes the answers (from /api/meta). The English text is the homepage's, in his voice.
